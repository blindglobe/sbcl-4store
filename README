The code has been used with Steel Bank Common Lisp, but should run
without issues in many if not most Common Lisp implementations.

Note that all the dependencies can be loaded using quicklisp, except
for cl-rdfxml. This library can be downloaded from
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~tayloj/CL-RDFXML/ and the code here illustrates
how to inform quicklisp to use this local library.
